# Bank Customer Churn Prediction using DNN and Hyperparameter Tuning with Talos

# Description:
A deep neural network model to predict customer churn in the banking industry, leveraging the Bank Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle and employing random search for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

# Abstract:
Customer churn is a critical issue faced by banks, resulting in the loss of valuable clients and revenue. This repository contains a deep neural network (DNN) model designed to predict customer churn using the "Bank Customer Churn Prediction.csv" dataset available on Kaggle. By accurately predicting churn, banks can identify at-risk customers and take appropriate actions to retain them, minimizing losses and maintaining a strong customer base.

The DNN model is built using popular deep learning libraries and employs a random search algorithm for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring an optimized model performance. The random search approach helps to identify the best combination of hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of hidden layers, resulting in improved prediction accuracy and reduced model training time.

By leveraging this model, banking institutions can better understand the factors contributing to customer churn and develop targeted strategies to enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention. The repository includes comprehensive documentation, outlining the steps for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation, ensuring ease of use and adaptability for similar projects in the future.
